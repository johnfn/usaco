This is where I will put solutions I write to USACO problems.

I will only put solutions here if I think they are beautiful. So there will 
probably be some holes. :) 

Do not steal these answers! If you haven't already solved the problem,
you shouldn't even look at the answer. Worse, if you lift the source code,
Rob Kolstad will probably kill you in your sleep.

USACO is all about learning and coding. You *can* solve each problem,
if you try hard enough.  I promise. You could even ask for help!



This is mostly a logbook for me to remember which solutions I was happy
with, and which solutions I should rewrite.
